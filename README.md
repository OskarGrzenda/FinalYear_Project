## React Native

React Native is a frameowrk which allows you to build cross-platform applications for Android and Ios. My main development focus was on a Android application. I decided to use React Native as my framework of choice as after I had done research on it, it seemed like it would be a good fit for my project and is a very popular framework for mobile app development.

## Expo

Expo is a framework that is built on top of React Native it is a command line CLI it allows you to run your application on different emulators and it allow you to access your mobile app on your physical device using a QR code there are no cables required. Expo also allows you to by pass writing any native code so you can write one set of JavaScrip code which gets compiled and runs on Ios and Android devices.
